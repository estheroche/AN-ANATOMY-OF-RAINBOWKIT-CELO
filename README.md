## 2.0 What is Celo?

[Celo](https://celowallet.app/setup) is a mobile-first blockchain with a focus on building an accessible, green financial system. In response to the numerous difficulties that well-known blockchain like Bitcoin and Ethereum are experiencing, the Celo blockchain was created. Currency with a Steady Value The price volatility of cryptocurrencies is a significant barrier to their widespread use as a means of exchange and accessibility. A expanding family of stablecoins, including cUSD, cEUR, cREAL, and USDC, are offered by Celo. These coins have a stable value and can even be used to pay transaction fees. The consensus processes used by Proof-of-Stake Bitcoin take a great deal of energy and result in expensive and frequently delayed transactions.

By mapping customers' phone numbers to their public keys, Celo enables users to send cryptocurrency using only their phone numbers. EVM Compatibility in Full In addition to allowing programmers to use the well-liked Solidity smart contract language, Celo is fully EVM compliant. This means that ERC-20 or ERC721-compliant tokens and Ethereum's tooling can both be used in the Celo ecosystem (NFT).

## 3.0 What is Rainbowkit?

A development kit called RainbowKit-celo enables programmers to create decentralized applications (dApps) quickly and easily on the Celo blockchain. An open-source blockchain technology called Celo wants to build an inclusive financial system.

## 4.0 What is a Smart Contract?

A Smart Contract is a computer software that automatically carries out the provisions of a contract. A blockchain, decentralized digital ledger that enables safe and open record-keeping, is often where these contracts are kept.

Once they are put up, smart contracts are self-executing and run without the need for human involvement. They can be used to automate a wide range of activities, including financial transactions, the exchange of property, and the transmission of information. They are programmed to enforce the terms and conditions of the contract.

The main benefit of smart contracts is that they can significantly minimize the need for middlemen and other third-party middlemen, such as attorneys and banks, which can lead to quicker and more affordable transactions.

They can also improve security and transparency because the contract's terms are stored on the blockchain, where they are immutable and impervious to tampering.
