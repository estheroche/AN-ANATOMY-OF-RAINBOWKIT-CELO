# 1.0 AN ANATOMY OF RAINBOWKIT-CELO

A robust and adaptable development kit created exclusively for the Celo blockchain is called RainbowKit-Celo. The kit offers developers a comprehensive collection of tools and resources to create decentralized apps (dApps) on the Celo network. It is developed and maintained by the Celo team. We will thoroughly examine the RainbowKit-Celo in this post, as well as its features, architecture, and code samples.

In this tutorial it is important to understand some certain concept in ranbowkit-celo so as to flow with the tutorial. These concept will be explained below.

# 2.0 WHAT IS CELO?

Celo is a mobile-first blockchain with a focus on building an accessible, green financial system. In response to the numerous difficulties that well-known blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum are experiencing, the Celo blockchain was created. Currency with a Steady Value The price volatility of cryptocurrencies is a significant barrier to their widespread use as a means of exchange and accessibility. A expanding family of stablecoins, including cUSD, cEUR, cREAL, and USDC, are offered by Celo. These coins have a stable value and can even be used to pay transaction fees. The consensus processes used by Proof-of-Stake Bitcoin take a great deal of energy and result in expensive and frequently delayed transactions.
By mapping customers' phone numbers to their public keys, Celo enables users to send cryptocurrency using only their phone numbers. EVM Compatibility in Full In addition to allowing programmers to use the well-liked Solidity smart contract language, Celo is fully EVM compliant. This means that ERC-20 or ERC721-compliant tokens and Ethereum's tooling can both be used in the Celo ecosystem (NFT).

# 3.0 WHAT IS RAINBOWKIT?

A development kit called RainbowKit-celo enables programmers to create decentralized applications (dApps) quickly and easily on the Celo blockchain. An open-source blockchain technology called Celo wants to build an inclusive financial system. On top of Celo, RainbowKit-celo offers developers a collection of tools and resources to create dApps that can communicate with the Celo blockchain.
A development kit called RainbowKit-Celo enables programmers to create and launch decentralized applications (dApps) on the Celo network. It offers a full suite of tools and resources to developers, streamlining the development process and lowering the time and effort required to create dApps on Celo.

# 4.0 WHAT IS SMART CONTRACT?

When specific preset criteria are satisfied, a smart contract is a computer software that automatically carries out the provisions of a contract. A blockchain, a decentralized digital ledger that enables safe and open record-keeping, is often where these contracts are kept.

Once they are put up, smart contracts are self-executing and run without the need for human involvement. They can be used to automate a wide range of activities, including financial transactions, the exchange of property, and the transmission of information. They are programmed to enforce the terms and conditions of the contract.

The main benefit of smart contracts is that they can significantly minimize the need for middlemen and other third-party middlemen, such as attorneys and banks, which can lead to quicker and more affordable transactions.

They can also improve security and transparency because the contract's terms are stored on the blockchain, where they are immutable and impervious to tampering.

# 5.0 WHAT DOES DEPLOYING SMART CONTRACT?

Moreover, RainbowKit-celo offers wallet connectivity for the Celo Wallet. By using dApps created using RainbowKit-celo, users may safely manage their Celo assets.

# 9.0 Using Rainbowkit-Celo to build DAPP

A few easy actions must be taken by developers in order to use RainbowKit-celo to create dApps:

Create a development environment: To create dApps on the Celo blockchain, developers must first create a development environment. Installing the necessary software and libraries, such as web3.js and the Celo client SDK, is usually required.

Choose a development framework: When creating dApps on the Celo blockchain, developers have a variety of development frameworks to select from. The widely used frameworks React and Vue.js.

Create and test the dApp: With RainbowKit-developer celo's tools, developers can begin constructing and testing their dApp once the development environment and framework have been configured.

# 10.0 Getting started with RainbowKit-celo

The following prerequisites need to be installed in order to launch RainbowKit-celo:

Node.js (v10.0.0 or later) (v10.0.0 or later);

Truffle (v5.0.0 or later) (v5.0.0 or later);

Node.js (version 12 or higher)

Solidity (version 0.8 or higher)

Celo CLI (version 1 or higher)

Git

After setting up these prerequisites, we can install RainbowKit-celo by using the command below:

# step 1: install RainbowKit-celo

npm install -g rainbow-cli

The RainbowKit-celo command-line program will then be installed on our system at large.

# step 2: Establishing a New Project

'rainbow init myproject'

'cd myproject'

The 'rainbow init' command can be used to start a new project with RainbowKit-celo. This program will pre-install RainbowKit-celo in a new Truffle project.

This will shift the working directory to the newly created project named myproject.

# step 3: Writing Smart Contract

        'truffle create contract MyContract'

For popular use cases like ERC20 tokens, voting contracts, and multisig wallets, RainbowKit-celo offers a number of pre-written smart contracts. These contracts can serve as a model for our own contracts, or we can draft them from scratch.

The 'truffle create contract' command can be used to create a new contract.

# step 4: Testing Smart Contract

A local blockchain network is offered by RainbowKit-celo for testing and development. This network can be launched by issuing the following command:

        'rainbow local'

Many accounts will be launched on a local blockchain network with test Celo currencies already in them (cUSD).

The truffle test command can be used to verify our smart contracts. Using this command, the neighborhood blockchain network will be used to execute our tests.

# step 5: Deloying Smart Contract

We must first register a Celo account and acquire some test cUSD before we can release our smart contracts to the Celo network. Afterwards, to deploy our contracts, we may use the command:

        'rainbow deploy'

The contract addresses will be returned along with the deployment of our contracts to the Celo network.

# step 6 : Interacting with Smart Contract

A set of command-line tools are provided by RainbowKit-celo for interfacing with the Celo blockchain. To list our Celo accounts, for instance, we may use the 'rainbow accounts' command:

        'rainbow accounts'

Our accounts will be shown here, along with the balances.

The 'rainbow call' command can also be used to invoke a deployed contract's function:

'rainbow call MyContract myFunction arg1 arg2'
